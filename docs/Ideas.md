**Idea for cool purple light:**

When mouse moves, a purple geometric pattern is shown in a certain px radius around the cursor's position. fades in and fades out.

Could be done by:

- putting the geometric image in background
- on mouse move, run css animation that fades in a blurred circle with blend mode to reveal background image
- the blurred circle's position will change based on cursor position

**Idea for project card hover effect:**

When user hovers over project card, img turns into gif that quickly shows the project's main functions
