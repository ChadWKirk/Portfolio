# Big Picture Stuff

Portfolio URL - [http://chad-kirk.com/](http://chad-kirk.com/)

## Project Goals:

This is a software engineering portfolio for Chad Kirk (me).

The main goal of this portfolio is to show off my design ability, software engineering ability and ultimately show a hiring manager I am a hireable software engineer.

I know that a hiring manager most likely has no time, is anxious about finding the right hire, and goes through hundreds of portfolios a day.

I will give a great first impression by

- showing an impressive design right away
- giving always available contact buttons that allow the hiring manager to call or email me
- keeping everything all on one page so there's no load time going from one thing to another
- show off my grit and show impressive projects

## Hosting and Git workflow:

### Site Is Hosted On Netlify:

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a freemium website hosting service. I set it up with my Github repo so that it deploys any time I push a commit to the main branch.

## Email:

There is a contact form on the bottom of the site so any potential hiring managers want to contact me.

There is also a [mailto link](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-mailto-links.html) in the navbar represented by a [font awesome 4.7](https://fontawesome.com/v4/get-started/) envelope icon.

The email contact form is done by using [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/). I used [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX) to handle submission to avoid Netlify's default behavior of redirecting to a success page.

## Image Optimization:

Images are optimized using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to lower the file size of all the images on the site inclunding pictures of myself, pictures of my projects, and the logos for the technologies that I use in the "Technologies I Use" section.
