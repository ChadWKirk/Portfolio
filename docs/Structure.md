#Structure/Content:

This is an outline of the structure/content of the portfolio.

1. **Navbar** - Chad Kirk (white) on left, phone icon and email icon (orange) on right. sticky but only when user scrolls up.

1. **Hero section** - (left side) Another (light) **boring** (strong) portfolio (light). (new line, light) something something something (new line) Projects "down arrow icon" (button orange BG white text)

(on right) pic of me in dark room with purple lights doing something on the computer

Maybe have some sort of purple lighting effect going on like a pulsing light or scrolling light or something. Be creative.

1. **Projects section** - (centered white with different font than hero section) Projects

Project Cards

1. **About Me Section** - (on left) About Me (new line) different pic of me doing something, (on right) have Short Story and Long Story buttons where active is either orange or puple and non active is light grey or white which each reveal a blurb of about me text.

1. **Persuassion Section** - Have 2 sections for this. One section will be reviews/feedback on my projects and the next section will be the technologies I use. This will provide a triple whammy in terms of impressing the potential employer when they see that I have real world users + positive feedback + I use the tech stack they need someone to know to work for them.

1. **Call To Action Section** - in this case it is a contact form section since I want hiring managers to contact me.
