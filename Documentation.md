#Portfolio Documentation:

This is a software engineering portfolio for Chad Kirk (me).

The main goal of this portfolio is to show off my design ability, software engineering ability and ultimately show a hiring manager I am a hireable software engineer.

I know that a hiring manager most likely has no time, is anxious about finding the right hire, and goes through hundreds of portfolios a day.

I will give a great first impression by

- showing an impressive design right away
- giving always available contact buttons that allow the hiring manager to call or email me
- keeping everything all on one page so there's no load time going from one thing to another
- showing an impressive story and impressive projects

##Design:

This section is for listing the design elements, goals and structure of the portfolio.

###Mood:

I'm going for a dark, underground and edgey mood.

###Color Scheme:

- black (background)
- purple (accent)
- orange (cta)
- white (text)

1. **Persuassion Section** - list some reasons why a hiring manager should hire me. Could be what I know, metrics on projects, projects I've worked on (open source, etc. brand recognition social proof), or testimonials/reviews.
